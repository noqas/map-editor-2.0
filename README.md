# map-editor-2.0

A simple map editor, similar to Paint, using Simple GFX Library.

// The idea
This was a challenge given by <Academia de CÃ³digo_>, where we had a grid and its cells could be painted, erased, saved and loaded.

// The Development
With instructions on the basic features (paint, erase, save, load), we later had the freedom to customize it as we wanted, implementing more colors, for example, or adding any other features to it.
I had problems implementing save and load features, but managed to solve it.

// Tech && Methodologies
Java 7, IntelliJ, Windows, Mac OS, Simple GFX, Git
